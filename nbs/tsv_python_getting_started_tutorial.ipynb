    "This notebook shows how to use the PostgreSQL as vector database via the [Python Vector python client library](https://github.com/timescale/python-vector). You'll learn how to use the client for (1) semantic search, (2) time-based vector search, (3) and how to create indexes to speed up queries.\n",

    "Sample dataset: We'll analyze a gitlog dataset (git commit messages) and use the vector embeddings of the commit messages to find relevant commit messages to a given query question. Each git commit entry has a timestamp associated with it, as well as natural language message and other metadata (e.g author, commit hash etc). \n",

    "## What is Timescale Vector?\n",
    "**[Timescale Vector](https://www.timescale.com/ai) is PostgreSQL++ for AI applications.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Timescale Vector enables you to efficiently store and query millions of vector embeddings in `PostgreSQL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enhances `pgvector` with faster and more accurate similarity search on 100M+ vectors via `DiskANN` inspired indexing algorithm.\n",
    "- Enables fast time-based vector search via automatic time-based partitioning and indexing.\n",
    "- Provides a familiar SQL interface for querying vector embeddings and relational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timescale Vector is cloud PostgreSQL for AI that scales with you from POC to production:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplifies operations by enabling you to store relational metadata, vector embeddings, and time-series data in a single database.\n",
    "- Benefits from rock-solid PostgreSQL foundation with enterprise-grade feature liked streaming backups and replication, high-availability and row-level security.\n",
    "- Enables a worry-free experience with enterprise-grade security and compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to access Timescale Vector\n",
    "Timescale Vector is available on [Timescale](https://www.timescale.com/ai), the cloud PostgreSQL platform. (There is no self-hosted version at this time.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Good news! You get a 90-day free trial for Timescale Vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To get started, [signup](https://console.cloud.timescale.com/signup?utm_campaign=vectorlaunch&utm_source=github&utm_medium=direct) to Timescale, create a new database and follow this notebook!\n",
    "- See the [Timescale Vector explainer blog](https://www.timescale.com/blog/how-we-made-postgresql-the-best-vector-database/?utm_campaign=vectorlaunch&utm_source=github&utm_medium=direct) for more details and performance benchmarks."

    "We'll use Timescale Vector to find similar commits to a given query within a time range.\n",

    "A key use case for Timescale Vector is efficient time-based vector search. Timescale Vector enables this by automatically partitioning vectors (and associated metadata) by time. This allows you to efficiently query vectors by both similarity to a query vector and time.\n",

    "Time-based vector search functionality is helpful for applications like:\n",
    "- Storing and retrieving LLM response history (e.g. chatbots)\n",
    "- Finding the most recent embeddings that are similar to a query vector (e.g recent news).\n",
    "- Constraining similarity search to a relevant time range (e.g asking time-based questions about a knowledge base)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how to run similarity searches with time range filters using the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first step to using time filtering with Timescale Vector is to create a table with the `time_partition_interval` argument set to the desired time interval. This will automatically partition the table into time-based chunks to speed up queries. We completed this step in Part 1 above.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, we ensure the `id` of our row is a `uuid` with a datetime portion that reflects the date and time we want to associated with the embedding. We completed this step in Part 2 above, where we used the `uuid_from_time()` method provided by the Timescale Vector library.\n",
